### Environment description

Ripple relies on the Fiber feature of PHP8.1+, so it needs to run in the PHP8.1+ environment. Not compatible with
Windows systems.

At the same time, we also encourage PHPer to use a more modern version of PHP so that it can better take advantage of
PHP's new features and tool libraries.

In 2024, PHP will still be a dynamic programming language. The release of PHP8.1 has brought new features to PHP, such
as fibers, static typing,
New tool libraries, etc. These features give PHP better support in terms of high performance, high concurrency,
asynchronous programming, etc.
