Returns a `Promise` object

### Overview

Promise (promise/expiration mechanism) is a core concept in the ripple framework and is used to handle asynchronous
operations. A Promise object represents the final completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, as well as its
result value.
Compared with Future, Promise provides a more intuitive API that is easier to understand and use.

### Usage

> Use this method to create a Promise object

```php
$promise = \Co\promise(Closure $callback): Promise
```

> ripple will provide two parameters for the closure function you submit, one is the `resolve` callback function and
> the other is the `reject` callback function.
> Use these two callback functions to resolve or reject a futures contract.

```php
$promise = \Co\promise(function ($resolve, $reject) {
    $resolve('success'); // Resolve a future contract
    
    // $reject('error'); // Reject a futures contract
    
    //TODO: More actions...
});
```

### Promise status

> A Promise object has three states:

- pending: initial state, neither success nor failure state.
  -fulfilled: means the operation was completed successfully.
- rejected: means the operation failed.

> A Promise object can only be converted from the `pending` state to the `fulfilled` or `rejected` state.
> Once converted to `fulfilled` or `rejected` state, it cannot be converted to other states again.

```php
$promise = \Co\promise(function ($resolve, $reject) {
    //TODO: Asynchronous operations such as reading files/network requests/database queries...

    $resolve('success'); // Resolve a future contract
});

// When the future contract is resolved, the callback function in the then method will be triggered.
$promise->then(function (mixed $result) {
    echo $value;
});

// When the futures contract is rejected, the callback function in the catch method will be triggered.
$promise->catch(function (Exception $e) {
    echo $reason;
});

$promise->await(); // Wait for the promise to be resolved
```

### Precautions

`resolve` and `reject` will only change the state and result of Promise and will not prevent subsequent code execution.
