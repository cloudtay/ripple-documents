## Process events

> In ripple, you can register an event that occurs after the process forks through the `forked` method, and execute the
> specified closure function in the child process after the fork.
> All fork events will be executed in the child process after the fork, and the registered processor will be forgotten
> after execution.

### API

```php
namespace Co;

function forked(Closure $closure): int;
function cancelForked(int $index): void;
```

```php
\Co\forked(function () {
    \Co\repeat(function () {
        echo 'repeat task';
    }, 1);
});

$task = \Co\System::Process()->task(function () {
    echo 'fork task';
});

$runtime = $task->run();
$runtime->await();
```

### Notes

> Using task to create a sub-process can put time-consuming tasks into the sub-process for execution to avoid blocking
> the main process. The child process will inherit all resources of the parent process.
> But all event handlers, including those registered with `forked` will be forgotten. Therefore, the event handler needs
> to be re-registered in the child process.

## Futures contract management

> `0.7.1` and above versions support `waitGroup`, `Promise::all`, `Promise::allSettled`, `Promise::futures` and other
> futures contract management methods. Used to control the execution of multiple asynchronous tasks.

### WaitGroup

> `WaitGroup` is used to wait for a group of contracts to be executed. It is usually used to wait for multiple contracts
> to be executed before performing the next step.
> Usually you need to initialize a `WaitGroup` object with a counter, or call the `add` method on the `WaitGroup` object
> to increase the counter.

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\WaitGroup;

$waitGroup = new WaitGroup(2);

\Co\async(static function () use ($waitGroup) {
    \Co\sleep(1);
    $waitGroup->done();
});

\Co\async(static function () use ($waitGroup) {
    \Co\sleep(1);
    $waitGroup->done();
});

$waitGroup->wait();
```

### Promise::all

> `Promise::all` is used to wait for a group of futures contracts to be executed and return the execution results of all
> futures contracts. It is usually used to wait for multiple contracts to be executed before performing the next step.
> It is worth noting that `Promise::all` will wait for all futures to be executed. Even if one of the futures fails to
> execute, you will get a failed future. and
> `Promise::all` will wait for all futures to be executed,
> Even if one of the futures fails to execute, you will get a failed future.

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\Promise;

$tasks = [];

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $tasks[] = \Co\async(static function () use ($i) {
        \Co\sleep(1);
        return $i;
    });
}

$result = Promise::all($tasks);
```

### Promise::allSettled

> `Promise::allSettled` is used to wait for a set of futures to be executed and return the set of futures objects for
> all futures, regardless of whether the futures execution is successful or failed.
> Usually used to wait for multiple contracts to be executed before performing the next step.

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\Promise;

$tasks = [];

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $tasks[] = \Co\async(static function () use ($i) {
        \Co\sleep(1);
        return $i;
    });
}

$promise = Promise::allSettled($tasks);
```

### Promise::futures

> `Promise::futures` does not wait for the execution of the future to complete, but immediately returns an iterator,
> which can be used to traverse the execution results of all futures' future objects.
> Tasks that are executed first will pop up first in the iterator

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\Promise;
use function Co\async;

$tasks = [];

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $tasks[] = async(static function () use ($i) {
        \Co\sleep(\mt_rand(1, 10));
        return $i;
    });
}

foreach (Promise::futures($tasks) as $future) {
    echo 'Coroutine is done ', $future, \PHP_EOL;
}

\Co\wait();
```

### Promise::any

> `Promise::any` is used to wait for any one of the futures in a set of futures to be executed, and return the execution
> result of the first completed future.

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\Promise;

use function Co\async;

$tasks = [];

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $tasks[] = async(static function () use ($i) {
        \Co\sleep(\mt_rand(1, 10));
        return $i;
    });
}

$promise = Promise::any($tasks)->then(function ($value) {
    echo 'Coroutine is done ', $value, \PHP_EOL;
});

```

### Promise::race

> `Promise::race` is used to wait for any one of the futures in a set of futures to be executed, and return the
> execution result of the first completed future.

```php
use Ripple\Coroutine\Promise;

$tasks = [];

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $tasks[] = \Co\async(static function () use ($i) {
        \Co\sleep(\mt_rand(1, 10));
        return $i;
    });
}


Promise::race($tasks)->then(function ($value) {
    echo 'Coroutine is done ', $value, \PHP_EOL;
});
```
