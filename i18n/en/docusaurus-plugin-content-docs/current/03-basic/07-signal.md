#### return value

Returns the unique identifier of the event, allowing the event to be canceled using the \Co\cancel method

### Overview

> ripple allows you to listen to system signals through the `onSignal` method and execute the specified closure
> function when the signal is triggered.

### Basic usage

```php
\Co\onSignal(SIGINT, function () {
    echo 'signal received';
    exit(0);
});
```

### Precautions

> After registering any signal handler, if the signal handler is not canceled correctly, \Co\wait will consider that
> there are unfinished events and will wait until all events are completed.
